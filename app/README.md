# 4 different flows (implemented as Activities):
- Registration: The user can register by introducing username, password and accepting our terms and conditions.
- Login: The user can log in using the credentials introduced during the registration flow and can also unregister from the app.
- Home: The user is welcomed and can see how many unread notifications they have.
- Settings: The user can log out and refresh the number of unread notifications (which produces a random number of notifications).
